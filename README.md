# python-api-challenge

Python API Project - What's the Weather Like?

This project utilizes API calls from OpenWeatherMap to obtain climate data.

The Python API script obtains data from 500 randomly selected cities from acorss the country.
Visualizations were created using matplotlib to show various climate relationships and scipy was used to model linear regressions for the plots.
Some of the relationships that were plotted include:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
